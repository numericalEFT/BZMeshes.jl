* Goal of the package

  The goal is to provide a unified solution to tabulate multi-dimensional momentum/space
  with high-efficient mesh grid. Several implementations with a unified API should be provided.

** TODO AbstractMesh [0/4]

   An abstract type with unified interface is expected to be implemented by all
   meshed define in this package:

   - [ ] AbstractMesh{T} <: AbstractArray{T} so that all the indexing and iterator tools are available
   - [ ] eltype(mesh) = SVector so that no dynamic allocate happens(currently Vector is used)
   - [ ] Monte Carlo support [0/2]
     - [ ] locate function gives the grid point that histogram should accumulate on
     - [ ] volume function gives the volume represented by the grid point
   - [ ] Numerical calculation support [0/2]
     - [ ] interp function gives interpolation
     - [ ] integrate function gives integration
     
** BaseMesh

   Basic mesh grids.


*** TODO UniformMesh [0/1]

   - [ ] visualization
   - [ ] symmetry reduce
   - [X] Monkhorst-Pack grid(CenteredMesh)
   - [ ] Examples [0/4]
     - [ ] 2D Square lattice
     - [ ] 2D triangular lattice
     - [ ] bcc
     - [ ] fcc
   - [ ] documentation

**** TODO Monkhorst-Pack grid [/]

     UniformMesh needs to be reconstructed to be compatible with M-P mesh used conventionally
     Terminology c.f. https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/KPOINTS
          
     - support generalized size (N1, N2, N3) instead of (N,N,N)
     - support optional shift between \Gamma-centered and M-P mesh
     - support Cartesian coordinate and fraction coordinate
