* Goal of the package

  The goal is to provide a unified solution to tabulate multi-dimensional momentum/space
  with high-efficient mesh grid. Several implementations with a unified API should be provided.

** TODO AbstractMesh [0/4]

   An abstract type with unified interface is expected to be implemented by all
   meshed define in this package:

   - [ ] AbstractMesh{T} <: AbstractArray{T} so that all the indexing and iterator tools are available
   - [ ] eltype(mesh) = Tuple/SVector so that no dynamic allocate happens(currently Vector is used)
   - [ ] Monte Carlo support [0/2]
     - [ ] locate function gives the grid point that histogram should accumulate on
     - [ ] volume function gives the volume represented by the grid point
   - [ ] Numerical calculation support [0/2]
     - [ ] interp function gives interpolation
     - [ ] integrate function gives integration
